1.Limit Switch
  Limit switches are common with user input, such as computer mice. But it can be used autonomously. If you were to put it on the front of a robot car, it could
  detect when it hits something, which the robot can take that information and back up away from the wall. 

2.Ultrasonic Sensor
  This is similar to the limit switch in the sense that it can detect when the robot is goign to hit something. Unlike the limit switch, it can sense distance.
  So you could use it to detect obstacles, but you can avoid them from a distance, and have the robot turn or back up earlier. 

3.Humiture Sensor
  This can be used to make a basic weather station. For example, you could hook up a LCD monitor to the Raspberry Pi and then display the temperature on the 
  monitor. So the Raspberry Pi would autonomously be able to sense the temperature and display it to the user.
