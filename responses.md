1. What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?
  The sensors recieve an input in some way and turn it into an eletrical signal, which is then interpreted by the Raspberry Pi.
  
2. What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?
  Pollution from other forms of inout. For example, if you are using an Ultrasonic Sensor, there could be some other sort of sound output recieved by the sensor 
  that is unwanted.
  
3. What role does coding play in this process?
  Along with controling/activating the sensors, code enables us to read the data and then make decisions with that data from the sensor.
